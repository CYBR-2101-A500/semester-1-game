# A Little Single-User Dungeon

Welcome to the class project for CYBER-2101-A500, Python Essentials!

## Running

First, download the files via GitHub Desktop or the git command line, so that you can keep them up to date.

Then, you can run individual files by going into your terminal, navigating to the containing folder, and running `python [filename]`.

As we continue to build this project, we will eventually make the different files more connected and will eventually have a main file that will launch and run the game.

## Contributing

Create a new branch and use that to make your updates. Then create a pull request and link to it in Netacad for discussion. After discussion and review, pull requests can be merged into master.
